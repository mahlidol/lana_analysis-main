He can only hold her for so long
The lights are on but no one's home
She's so vacant Her soul is taken
He thinks "What's she running from?"
Now how can he have her heart
When it got stole
So he tries to pacify her
'Cause what's inside her never dies
Even if she's content in his warmth
She is plagued with urgency
Searching kisses
The man she misses
The man that he longs to be
Now how can he have her heart
When it got stole
So he tries to pacify her
'Cause what's inside her never dies
So he tries to pacify her
Cause what's inside her, it never dies

So he tries to pacify her
Cause what's inside her never dies
