i’m sorry to her, but
never to you

no one will ever again
immortalize you like i have
it's a pitiful blessing
if you ask me

you live on in my art, but
i killed the real you long ago

no one asks mona lisa
what her favorite colour is
not only because 
she’s dead
but because such things 
simply never mattered
